# âœ¨ Glowup âœ¨

## The most goated Babel plugin

This plugin was high key inspired by an Instagram reel by @justin.makes.things: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cwn5KYtIWDm/

I was shook. I thought it hit different so I said "bet" and started flexin on em. IYKYK fam.

## What does it do?

It transpiles gen z slang into valid JavaScript.

This was a fun project to increase my AST rizz. I'm a Babel simp now ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

### How to use it

`npm install babel-plugin-glowup-vibes --save`
Set up babel and add `babel-plugin-glowup-vibes` to your list of plugins.

In case you need more detailed instructions than that:
Create a `babel.config.json` file and add the following to it:
```
{
    "presets": [
        [
            "@babel/preset-env",
            {
                "targets": {
                    "edge": "17",
                    "firefox": "60",
                    "chrome": "67",
                    "safari": "11.1"
                },
                "useBuiltIns": "usage",
                "corejs": "3.6.5"
            }
        ]
    ],
    "plugins": ["babel-plugin-glowup-vibes"]
}
```

Add something like this to your `package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel ./src/script.js --out-file ./lib/compiled.js"
},
